The only way out is through Jargon-infested swamps, gates guarded by perfect logic, and the perils of breakfast time at the <i>Philosopher's Diner</i>. With just her wits and the help of a lizard who thinks he's a dinosaur, Laurie has to find her own way home.<br><br>Then one day you get a call from the <em>White House.</em> They ask you to come to DC to talk with policymakers and other people like you from around the country. You have one week to prepare!</p></blockquote>
